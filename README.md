## About
Discord stores **every, single, image** you view onto your hard drive; and this can lead to bad things, especially if someone sends you questionable material.<br />This script eliminates those issues, by attempting to recover the original file types, save them for viewing and clearing the cache folders.

You may of noticed the Windows word; well, sadly, I have no experience with other platforms.<br />Please gladly submit a PR; for that specific platform; thanks ðŸ’–

- Convert the cached files for all clients into the best matched file type
